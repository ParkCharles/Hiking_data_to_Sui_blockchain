Garmin Hiking Data Integration with SUI Blockchain

This project demonstrates how to integrate Garmin hiking data into a service that records and stores the data on the SUI blockchain. The goal is to create a simple yet effective way to track hiking activities, including essential metrics like location, elevation, and time, while utilizing the decentralized benefits of blockchain technology.

Features:

	•	Garmin Data Collection: Retrieves hiking data from Garmin devices, including coordinates (latitude and longitude), elevation, and timestamps.
	•	SUI Blockchain Integration: Stores the collected hiking data securely on the SUI blockchain.
	•	Simple Web Service: Provides an easy-to-use service to upload and access hiking data stored on the blockchain.

Technologies:

	•	SUI Blockchain: For secure, decentralized storage and management of hiking data.
	•	Garmin API: For retrieving and processing hiking data from Garmin devices.
	•	Rust Programming Language: Used for backend development and blockchain interactions.

Use Case:

This service is designed for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who want to track their hiking data in a secure, immutable way, leveraging blockchain technology to preserve and share their activity logs.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and suggest improvements!
